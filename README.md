# skydivestats

Use a 3D printed altimeter to show jump statistics from the Skywin database<p>

Demo JSON url: https://demo.skywin.se/api/v1/reports/jump-stats.json
<br>
Example output: {"name":"jump-stats","params":"[jumpYear:2025]","result":[{"Tandem":0,"NonTandem":114}],"size":2}<p></p>

Idea is to use a stepper motor and a hall sensor and to move the motor to represent the number of jumps made the current season. One version for tandem and one version for non tandem.
